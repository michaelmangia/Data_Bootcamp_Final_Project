Project Description:

This project aims to determine who the most "clutch" National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks have been since 2009. In football, it is imperative to have a quarterback who performs well under pressure and can help a team win when they are losing late in a game. To achieve our goal, we have obtained data of every single NFL play since 2009.

This project has three parts. The first part is an analysis of overall quarterback play since 2009 using a metric known as passer rating. We first calculate this metric and then demonstrate who the best passers have been according to this rating.

Secondly, our project will then delve into clutch performance. In the project, we calculate 2 different metrics of clutch performance and then compare every player according to these two metrics.

Finally, our project looks at the relationship between good overall players and clutch players. Could having a higher passer rating correlate with being a clutch player? We use data visualization and statistics to help demonstrate this specific relationship.
